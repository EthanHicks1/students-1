## About Me
I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student in the Bredesen Center's [Data Science and Engineering PhD program](https://bredesencenter.utk.edu/the-data-science-and-engineering-phd/). 

My academic background is in geography, GIS, & spatial statistics, graduating from UTK's Geography department with a BA ('10) and MS ('13). Since 2013, I have been working full-time at ORNL in the Geographic Data Sciences Group, where my work has transitioned away from traditional GIS (think ArcGIS) to focus on data science applications in geography, specifically data processing, mining, and warehousing for spatio-temporal data

I am a part time student and this is the only class I am taking this semester.

I'm married to my wife Ashley, have a wonderful 2 year old daughter, and dog named Charlie.


## What I'd like to get out of this class? 
I would like to become more familiar with designing data intensive applications from a data architecture perspective as well as an analysis point of view, getting hands on experience with big data technologies such as HDFS, Apache Parquet, Arrow, Spark, etc. and understanding the trade offs and use cases for certain architectural designs.


## Projects
The project I have in mind for this class designing and building an architecture for the ingestion, storage, and analysis of UAV sensor telemetry data. 

UAVs or other IoT connected devices provide streams of data associated with the status and conditions that the sensor is currently under, typically at a rate of several messages per second over a long period of time. This data can be used for early alert systems, and even predictive maintain on the sensor itself. However to make use of this data careful consideration must be given to the data architecture to insure analysis and retrieve can be down in a scalable and cost effective manner.
