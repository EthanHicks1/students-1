I am Maria Mahbub, a first-year Data Science and Engineering Ph. D. student. My research interest lies in the area of machine learning and deep learning. 

The Digital Archeology course in the previous semester somehow helped me grow a keen interest in text analysis, especially while doing the final project on disaster-related tweet analysis provided by a team of CURENT. I, along with 3 other students have worked on a dataset consisting of tweets on hurricane Florence. This project is basically focused on analyzing interesting human responses via tweets before, during and after any disaster. This analysis of human reactions is based on extensive text analysis including sentiment analysis and clustering. For this class, I would like to carry on with this twitter project. Previously for clustering, we have used 2 different unsupervised learning algorithms: K-means and LDA. I look forward to using NMF and GloVe for further analysis. I am also looking forward to learning about image analysis in this class. As a whole, I believe that this course will help me develop my knowledge on this and some other relevant areas .
