My name is Linsey, I am a first year student in the Data Science and Engineering PhD program. I currently work at ORNL in the Computational Earth Sciences group studying the efficiency of high resolution climate models. Currently, we are testing the new DOE Earth Systems Model's ability to simulate tropical cyclones. I am looking forward to applying what I learn in this class (namely advanced data analysis and grahpical models) to my research at ORNL.
