# Background
My name is Brett Bass and I am a Data Science and Engineering PhD student. 
I received my Bachelors and Masters Degrees from The University of Dayton in Mechanical Engineering and Energy Engineering respecitvely. 
I learned some Data Science while doing Masters research and while working for Emerson Climate Technologies after graduation for more than a year.
My research is in the field of building energy modeling. 
The group I work in at ORNL is Building Technologies Research & Integration Center - BTRIC. 
We model buildings and use these models to improve energy efficiency and environmental compatibility of residential and commerical buildings.

# Project
I haven't decided on a final project to this point. 
I plan to meet with my research advisor when he returns from travel to discuss possible work. 
We were confident that we could find something related to work on when we looked over the tentative syllabus last semester.
