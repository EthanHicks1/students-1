hi ~ I'm Trish Goedecke, a Memphis-based statistician and student in the Data Science doctoral program.

I am in this class to develop expertise with managing and analyzing complex data sets. I'll be working on Memphis property data, cooperating with Memphis' Neighborhood Preservation Inc (NPI) to predict property vacancies from existing data. 

Data sets available include for certain neighborhoods, code violations, observed blight indicators, utility disconnections, and failure to pay property taxes. On the city scale, data includes property values, ownership type, slated demolitions and county sales of properties claimed due to tax payment failure. Part of the challenge will be negotiating between neighborhood and municipal scales, putting data to good use. From this course, I expect to benefit from guidance in merging data at multiple scales, and analyzing appropriately.
