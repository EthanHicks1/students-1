I am a second year PhD student in the Bredesen Center Data Science and Engineering program. My area of research focuses on using deep learning for natural language processing and understanding, especially in the domain of biomedical sciences. I work with the Biomedical Sciences, Engineering, and Computing (BSEC) group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

My current thesis work is focused on the development of novel deep learning architectures to extract critical information from cancer pathology reports. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) stores detailed cancer pathology reports of the majority of cancer cases collected by its registries throughout the United States. Extracting useful information such as cancer site or histology from pathology reports is usually done manually by specialists who are trained with specific knowledge for understanding the contents of the reports. This process is very costly and time-consuming, thereby limiting NCI's ability to extract useful data fields from existing pathology reports and restricting time-sensitive applications such as precision medicine. Given that cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, there is an immediate need to modernize the information extraction process. Our latest architecture, Hierarchical Self-Attention Networks (HiSANs), is specifically designed for information extraction from pathology reports and has achieved a new state-of-the-art in accuracy, is faster to train compared to similar hierarchical architectures, and has a decision making process that is easy for humans to interpret -- this work is currently under review. Our previous work with a different deep learning architecture is available online [here](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocx131).

In this class, I'd like to get a better understanding of network analysis and graph-based approaches, as these are area that I am less familiar with.

For my final project, I would like to work on a project related to my thesis work. This will most likely mean development of additional deep learning models for information extraction from cancer pathology reports. I plan incorporate any knowledge gained from the text analysis portion of this class.
