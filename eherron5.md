# Background
My name is Emily Herron and I am a first year Bredesen Center Data Science and Engineering PhD student. I am involved in research in ORNL's Computational Data Analytics group. My primary project is developing improvements to the selection proceedure of MENNDL, an evolutionary algorithm-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm for deep learning. 

# Objectives
By taking this course, I hope to broaden my understanding of advanced algorithms and tools used in Data Science. I would especially like to improve my understanding of text analysis and graphical models. 

# Projects
I have two ideas for projects for this class. The first is the continuation of the Twitter Data Analysis project from last semester's COSC 545. Previously, my research group obtained a dataset of disaster-related tweets and investigated methods for separating each based on content.
