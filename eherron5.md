# Background
My name is Emily Herron and I am a first year Bredesen Center Data Science and Engineering PhD student. I am currently involved with research in ORNL's Computational Data Analytics group. My primary project entails developing improvements to the selection proceedure of MENNDL, an evolutionary algorithm-based hyperparameter optimization aprroach for deep learning.   

# Objectives
By taking this course, I hope to broaden my understanding of advanced algorithms and tools used in Data Science. I would especially like to improve my understanding of text analysis and graphical models. 

# Projects
My project idea for this course involves improving upon the methods of the Twitter Data Analysis project from last semester's COSC 545. Previously, my research group obtained a dataset of disaster-related tweets and investigated methods for analyzing the tweets in order to separate them by content. In the next phase of the project, we would like to formulate a more robust approach for determining whether a given tweet refers to certain geographic locations, especially low income areas, and refining our approach to clustering and labeling the tweets by topic. Through taking this course, I hope to become exposed to text analysis methods that may be useful for achieving these project goals.
