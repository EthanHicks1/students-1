# Background
My name is Emily Herron and I am a first year Bredesen Center Data Science and Engineering PhD student. I am involved in research in ORNL's Computational Data Analytics group. My primary project is developing improvements to the selection proceedure of MENNDL, an evolutionary algorithm-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm for deep learning. 

# Objectives
By taking this course, I hope to broaden my understanding of advanced algorithms and tools used in Data Science. I would especially like to improve my understanding of text analysis and graphical models. 

# Projects
I have two project ideas for this course. The first involves improving upon the methods of the Twitter Data Analysis project from last semester's COSC 545. Previously, my research group obtained a dataset of disaster-related tweets and investigated methods for analyzing the tweets in order to separate them by content. In the next phase of the project, we would like to formulate a more robust approach for determining whether a given tweet refers to a low income area, identifing tweets referring to certain geographic locations, and refining our approach to clustering and labeling the tweets by topic.
Another project that I think would be applicable to
