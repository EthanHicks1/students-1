I am a first-year Data Science and Engineering PhD student with the Bredesen Center. My background is in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. 

In the Fundamentals of Digital Archaeology, I worked on a project which involved finding the best thumbnails for videos in a collection. This project has missing features, such as noise removal and the ability to efficiently handle cases where more videos are added to a collection during or after processing. I would like to either continue this or begin work on a new project. I am currently working on a project to determine the performance-based meaning of hardware counters in various CPU architectures. The goal is to define an accurate mapping between particular high-level concepts of performance metrics (e.g. L1 data cache misses) and underlying, low-level hardware events. The current stage in this project is comparing test signatures against a set of known signatures. All signatures contain stochastic noise, but there are visible patterns despite the noise. This project could greatly benefit from data science techniques.
