I am a first-year Data Science and Engineering PhD student with the Bredesen Center. My background is in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. My research involves developing a microbenchmark suite to determine the performance-based nature of hardware counters in various CPU architectures.

In the Fundamentals of Digital Archaeology, I worked on a project which involved finding the best thumbnails for videos in a collection. This project has missing features, such as noise removal and the ability to efficiently handle cases where more videos are added to a collection during or after processing. I would like to either continue this or begin work on a new project. One such project could be scalable quality threshold clustering (QTC) software. This would be useful for applications involving big data because this clustering algorithm is robust with regards to a guaranteed quality threshold. However, it is a computationally expensive technique. I know a professor in the department who can provide guidance and serve as a customer.
