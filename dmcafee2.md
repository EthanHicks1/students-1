My name is Dustin McAfee, and I graduated Maryville College in 2016 with a B.A. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Computer Science; immediately after graduation,
I worked as a ORAU fellow at the FDA in White Oak, Maryland as a software engineer responsible for porting and parralelizing electrocardiogram analysis software to
the super computer on their campus (High Performance Integrated Virtual Environment or HIVE), which originally was only used for next-generation genetic sequencing (NGS).
I started a PhD program at UTk in Fall 2017 for HPC in Computer Science. My original project at UT was to create a push model for input events in the linux kernel and 
Android operating system. Unfortunately for me, my advisor is retiring after this semester, and so my current project is to determine frequencies (collect some data) in
event polling algorithms used in the linux kernel and Android operating system in order to compare power efficiency between input handling methods for specific sensor applications.
