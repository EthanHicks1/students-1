# Background Information
I'm currently a first year graduate student here at UT studying computer science.
I'm originally from Chattanooga, TN, and I graduated with my undergraduate degree
in Computer Science from UT in Fall 2018. I'm excited to start a new semester in this course.

# Projects
A project I'm already working on is a cryptocurrency address scraper for the VolSec security group. I'm trying to find cryptocurrency addresses from political candidates' websites and use them to do some analysis regarding how political candidates handle donation reporting.
