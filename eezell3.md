I am Evan Ezell. I come from a computer science background and I am a PhD Data Science and Engineering student in the Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary Studies.

This past summer I developed a graphical web application in the R shiny framework which visualizes the commuting time and distances in the Knoxville area. I would like to work on a paper which continues this work and gives a more in depth analysis to the commuting flow data in Knoxville and potentially extend my findings to other metropolitan statistical areas. The end goal, which may not be reached by the end of this class is to classify metropolitan statistical areas based on their commuting flows and tie this into other demographic data. This is a project that I could potentially use for my dissertation research.
