My name is Cai John

# Background
I have an undergraduate degree in physics and am currently pursuing a PhD in Data science.

I would like to develop more sophisticated data mining and analysis techniques as well as familiarize myself with industry standard protocols.

# Projects
I am currently beginning research into anti-malarial drug resistance. 
My research in this subject has not begun extensively so my understanding is relatively naive. I hope to meet with my supervisor and have the 
chance to expand my understanding soon to allow me to integrate the work done in this class with my research for maximal benefit.
I also have an interest in oceanic research but there is not currently much space
for analytics within this research domain.
